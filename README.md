MongoDB Go Example

This repository contains a simple Go program that demonstrates how to connect to a MongoDB server and perform some basic operations.

To run the example, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure that MongoDB is running on your local machine (e.g., by running mongod).
3. In the root directory of the repository, run go run main.go.

The program will connect to the MongoDB server, create a database named "users_details" and a collection named "users" in that database, and insert a document into the collection
